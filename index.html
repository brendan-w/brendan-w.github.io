I enjoy almost everything code related, and have a passion for building systems and mechanisms. I have always been compelled to build and tinker, both in my spare time, and at work. From C++ to flame working, I\'ll learn whatever I have to to scratch my itch.</p><p>Currently, I am a senior majoring in New Media Interactive Development at <a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>. While my major satisfies my love for interactive systems, I am equally interested in what goes on behind the scenes. Algorithms, cryptography, and kernel programming are all topics that I pursue. To that end, I have also developed a strong interest in the Free &amp; Open Source Software community, and am proud to be <a href=http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html>minoring in FOSS at RIT</a>.</p><p>In my spare time, I can be found playing guitar, doing fun things with lasers, and woodworking. My passions music and woodworking have since led me to the art of building pipe organs, and I am currently designing my 3<sup>rd</sup> organ (no joke). I also work as a glass artist at <a href="http://robinlehmanglass.com/">Robin Lehman Glass</a>, a local shop here in Rochester.</p><p>Other fun links</p><ul><li><a href="https://brendanwhitfield.wordpress.com/">Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-whitfield-3b87aa89>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></div><div class=col><img src=/assets/me.jpg></div></div></section>'},{}],3:[function(e,t){t.exports='<section><h3>OpenScope</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>Arduino, Processing, controlP5</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/openscope>https://github.com/brendan-w/openscope</a></td></tr><tr><td>Download</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/openscope/releases/tag/v1.0>https://github.com/brendan-w/openscope/releases/tag/v1.0</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>GPL v2</td></tr></table><p>This is a software package for turning an Arduino into a cheap oscilloscope. The front-end is written in Processing, and provides controls for pin selection, triggering, and sample rate. Data is collected via the Arduino’s 6 ADC pins, and triggered/buffered on the chip. This allows for sample rates of up to 25kHz.</p><p>In order to achieve better results, it was necessary to process and buffer the signal on the Arduino itself. While this does present severe memory constrictions, it goes a long way to preserve the temporal consistency of the readings. Functions such as triggering (signal stabilization) can also be done on the Arduino, and serves to lighten the load on the serial connection. This alone dramatically increases the sample rate of the system. More speed was also coaxed out of the <code>analogRead()</code> by <a href="http://www.microsmart.co.za/technical/2014/03/01/advanced-arduino-adc/">adjusting prescale registers in the AVR</a>.</p><p>The interface is built with <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/">controlP5</a> by Andreas Schlegel, and provides the basic tools of a standard oscilloscope.

With a quiz-based system, facts about the planets are gradually dispensed to the user as they answer questions correctly. This gradual progression helps prevent \\"information overload,\\" and ensure that the user has learned the existing content before advancing to more difficult concepts. Written with Python and Pygame, this application runs both on the OLPC, and as a standalone Pygame app.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/planetary.png"></div></div></section><section><h3>Web Synth</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>JavaScript</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td><a href="http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/synth/">http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/synth/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/web_synth>https://github.com/brendan-w/web_synth</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>GPL v2</td></tr></table><p>This is a web-based multi-track synthesizer. Using the classic grid style sequencer, the user is able to layer multiple melodies, each with settings for key, octave, scale, and wave type. A &lt;canvas&gt; in each track also displays the individual wave-forms.</p><p>Under the hood, this site makes heavy use of the Web Audio API. A signal chain composed of oscillators, gain nodes, and waveshaper nodes is used to create the audio. A master timer in the Main.js file advances the current beat on each track, and each track enables and disables the oscillators corresponding to the notes on the sequencer. In order to be polyphonic, each row of the sequencer (each pitch) has its own dedicated oscillator. When the user changes the key or the scale, all of the oscillators are set to new frequencies according to built in music theory functionality.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/synth.png"></div></div></section><section><h3>15-Puzzle Solver</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>Actionscript 3</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/as3_15puzzle>https://github.com/brendan-w/as3_15puzzle</a></td></tr></table><p>This program allows the user to solve the classic 15 tile puzzle by hand, or have the computer find a solution. Solutions are generated using the A* search algorithm implemented with the Manhattan Distance heuristic. The solver explores each possible move, and then selects the move that is closest to a finished puzzle (as quantified by the Manhattan Distance). When a solved puzzle state has been reached, the solution is played back for the user to enjoy.</p><p>Of course, this algorithm quickly generates large tree structures that must be searched and traversed. For efficiency, this program maintains a hash table of nodes. This helps when checking for puzzle collisions, which prevents infinite cycles of moves from destroying the search. Due to the large process size, this program also self-regulates its search (iterations per time) so that the interface does not go unresponsive.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/15puzzle.png"></div></div></section><section><h3>3D Graphics Engine</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>Actionscript 3</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/as3_3d-graphics>https://github.com/brendan-w/as3_3d-graphics</a></td></tr></table><p>Built and derived from scratch, this project uses a 2D turtle graphics system to render 3D objects. A system of classes representing 3D points, polygons and solids was created to represent the model. The original 2D Turtle class was extended with functions capable of drawing 3D objects. Upon startup, the document class procedurally generates a unique fracture pattern for the glass, and gives it to the turtle for rendering.</p><p>On every frame of the animation, a rotation matrix is applied to slowly turn the model. The shading for each polygon is also recalculated to allow for a slight glint in the glass. This was done by computing the angle between each polygon\'s surface normal and the camera\'s forward vector. When drawing, the system also interpolates between vertices to allow for the slight curved lens distortion.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/3d.png"></div></div></section><section><h3>Interactive Optics</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>Actionscript 3</td></tr></table><p>This is an interactive book that teaches optics. Featuring a mock optical bench, the user can click &amp; drag lenses into a simulated beam of light. Once placed, the user can see how each lens deflects the rays. This provided several challenges, such as implementing Snells Law, and computing lens/ray intersections.</p><p>Each beam segment is simply a vector. Originating on the left side of the page, beam segments travel until they intersect with a lens. The vertical position of the intersection is calculated, along with the curvature at that point, and the beam is deflected according to Snell\'s Law.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/optics.png"></div></div></section><section><h3>Gravitational Asteroids</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>Java, Processing</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/processing_asteroids>https://github.com/brendan-w/processing_asteroids</a></td></tr></table><p>This game is a derivative of Asteroids, but with the twist of gravity. The planet in the middle of the screen generates a gravitational pull on the asteroids, bringing them into elliptical orbits. The player\'s objective (in addition to not getting hit), is to protect the planet from collisions.</p><p>Because gravity naturally produces stable orbits, a slight frictional force has been added to every asteroid. Over time, this causes the orbits to decay, resulting in collisions with the planet. Asteroids may also collide with one another. These collisions are perfectly elastic, and are influenced by the mass of each asteroid. Asteroids that are bounced or flung off screen are denoted by a red arrow that follows the object.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/asteroids.png"></div></div></section><section><h3>ASCII Art Painter</h3><div class=row><div class=col><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>JavaScript, jQuery</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td><a href="http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/ascii/">http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/ascii/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/ascii/draw.js>http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/ascii/draw.js</a></td></tr></table><p>This tool lets you draw ASCII Art. Simply by clicking and dragging, the tool will find the characters that most closely approximate the users gesture. Under the hood, the user is simply drawing 1px strokes onto a canvas. This canvas is then split into character sized segments, which are rendered to the individual characters you see on screen.</p><p>To convert between pixels and characters, the software compares image data to an internal data set representing the font. Things such as the bounding box and quadrant pixel densities are metrics used to select the nearest character. While the drawn image must be processed on the fly, the internal font data set was pre-computed using the same algorithms in Processing.</p></div><div class=col><img src="assets/projects/ascii.png"></div></div></section>'},{}],4:[function(e,t){t.exports='<section><h2>Binary Digraph Visualization</h2><div class=row><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>JavaScript</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td><a href="http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/binvis/">http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/binvis/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/binvis>https://github.com/brendan-w/binvis</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>MIT</td></tr></table></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>It all started with this <a href=http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_domas_the_1s_and_0s_behind_cyber_warfare>TED talk by Chris Domas</a>.

So, instead of doing a full syntax parse (that requires numerous headers), this system only searches for function calls and definitions. Once located, they can be linked by name, location, and storage class to generate a call graph.

It presents the user\'s files as a flat data structure, where they can be selected by tag name, or by manual inclusion and exclusion. These tags can be arbitrarily added or removed from files, and can even be queried with logical set operations.</p></div><div class=col><p>While many commercial operating systems already support some form of file tagging, Linux does not, and it is difficult to port existing data from one OS to another. Because of this, tags are stored directly in the file\'s name and path. This allows directory names to function as tags, which helps represent existing folder structures in Collector. When tags are added or removed, Collector will either splice text from the file name, or move the file to a different place in the directory tree. Not only does this help maintain an organized directory structure, but also prevents the need to synchronize a tag database with the file system.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Interface</h3><div class=row><img src=/assets/projects/collector.png></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>Collector displays files as a continuous spectrum of square tiles. Files can be selected by simply typing tag selectors into the bar at the top of the window. This will illuminate the selected files in the spectrum, and will load thumbnail previews in the lower half of the window. To help navigate the tag-space, sample tag names are displayed underneath various regions of the spectrum, and a list of sub-tags for the current selection is also shown.</p></div><div class=col><p>Double-clicking on a file (either the tile, or the preview) will open that file in the user\'s default application. Out of the box, this is done using the <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-open>xdg-open</a> utility. When files are opened, Collector will also fill a temporary directory with symlinks to the currently selected files. This makes it easy to work with your file selections in other programs, such as image preview applications.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Tag Handling</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>Tags are parsed from the file path by splitting them on several delimiters. Currently, these delimiters are <code>,_&amp;=%.-+ ()[]{}/\\</code>. For instance, the following file path would be parsed into these tags:</p><p><code>/sensors &amp; measurement/telescopes/james_web_primary_mirror.jpg</code></p><p><code>sensors</code>&nbsp;<code>measurement</code>&nbsp;<code>telescopes</code>&nbsp;<code>james</code>&nbsp;<code>web</code>&nbsp;<code>primary</code>&nbsp;<code>mirror</code></p><p>For safety, file extensions are always ignored, and will never be operated upon during the tagging process.</p><p>Since directory names can function as tags, the addition or removal of tags may move a file to a different directory. To prevent files from being moved too far, a <code>.tagdir</code> file can be placed at the root of your desired folder structure. This will serve as a boundary for file movements, and will later be used to store settings for that particular tag directory.</p></div><div class=col><p>Selections are made by writing simple tag selectors. Files can be matched with bare tags names, or with the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> operators. For instance, the following selection:</p><p><code>space telescope -hubble</code></p><p>will select all of the files with the tags <code>space</code> and <code>telescope</code>, but will exclude any files with the tag <code>hubble</code>. Alternatively, one can use the <code>+</code> operator to include a new tag in the selection. For example:</p><p><code>space telescope -hubble +cats</code></p><p>this selection will include all of the same files as before, but will also include every file tagged with <code>cats</code>. In cases where a file is tagged with both <code>hubble</code> and <code>cats</code>, the later selector (<code>+cats</code>) will take precedence.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>CLI</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>In an effort to follow the doctrine of UNIX, Collector has spawned a separate CLI application to handle the grunt-work of manipulating tags. This CLI, written in python, allows directory structures to be accessed as if they were sets of tagged files. Multiple tags can be added or removed from files with a single command. Files can also be queried with logical set operations, just like Collector.</p></div><div class=col><pre><code class=language-bash>\n# the directory structure BEFORE tagging\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── .tagdir\n├── a/\n└── some_dir/\n    └── file.txt\n\n# remove tag "dir"\n# add tag "a"\n$ tag -dir +a some_dir/file.txt\n\n# the directory structure AFTER tagging\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── .tagdir\n├── a/\n│   └── some_file.txt\n└── some_dir/\n			</code></pre></div></div></section>'},{}],7:[function(e,t){t.exports='<section><h2>Execute JS</h2><div class=row><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>JavaScript, UglifyJS2</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td><a href="http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/exejs/">http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/exejs/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/execute-js>https://github.com/brendan-w/execute-js</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>LGPL v3</td></tr></table></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>This tool visualizes JavaScript as it executes in a web browser.

There are currently two solvers available. One solver recursively searches for the layout with the least loss, while the other uses a less brute force technique to find a sub-optimal layout. The recursive solver is guaranteed to return an optimal layout, however, it is not always practical due to its slow speeds with large inputs. When this happens, the sub-optimal solver may be preferable.</p><p>Internally, the optimal solver uses double recursion to permute through the various combinations of cut sizes and source material sizes. To accelerate the process, the recursive functions do not operate on individual board objects, but loop through the size choices provided by the user. This prevents the computer from trying the same board size more than once at any given step in the process.</p></div><div class=col><p>The sub-optimal solver is essentially a narrower version of the full solver, because it only performing single recursion. Rather than testing for minimum loss on whole, completed layouts, this solver only operates on one board at a time. It loops through each available board size, and uses recursion to find the best arrangement of cuts on that board. The computer then selects the board size (and cut pattern) that generated the least loss, and then moves on. This process is repeated until there are no more cuts left to make. A useful property of this solver is that it will always return optimal layouts when all source materials are marked as unlimited.</p><p>To handle unlimited quantities, the computer will simply add as many source boards as there are cuts. This ensures that there is at least one source board for every cut. If a cut size is larger than any of the users sources, the solver will fail, and an error message will be displayed.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class=col><img src=/assets/projects/lumber_before.png></div><div class=col><img src=/assets/projects/lumber_after.jpg></div></div></section>'},{}],11:[function(e,t){t.exports="<section><h2>Pipe Organs</h2><div class=row><div class=col><p>One of my admittedly weirder interests is pipe organs.

It seamlessly handles the decoding of data from the car, and returns values with units to the programmer. Derived from the popular <a href=https://github.com/peterh/pyobd>pyobd</a> project, this package attempts to do a better job of decoupling the serial operations from the UI code.</p></div><div class=col><p>This project started as a fork of another OBD project called pyobd. Since then, the code has been almost completely overhauled. The library now makes better use of the Python stdlib, supports more sensors, and presents a simple API for accessing the car\'s data. Sensors (commands) can now be accessed by name, or Parameter ID. Threaded callbacks can also be subscribed, allowing for asynchronous applications.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Code Examples</h3><div class=row><div class=col><pre><code class=language-python>\nimport obd\n\nconnection = obd.OBD() # auto-connects to USB or RF port\n\ncmd = obd.commands.RPM # select an OBD command (sensor)\n\nresponse = connection.query(cmd) # send the command\n\nprint(response) # "2410 RPM"\n            </code></pre><p>This is a simple script that prints the current RPM of the engine. <code>Response</code> objects contain all of the decoded information from the request, such as the value and units for the sensor.</p></div><div class=col><pre><code class=language-python>\nimport obd\nimport time\n\nconnection = obd.Async() # create an asynchronous connection\n\n# will continuously print new RPM values\ndef new_value(response):\n	print(response)\n\n# keep track of the car\'s RPM\nconnection.watch(obd.commands.RPM, callback=new_value)\n\nconnection.start()\ntime.sleep(5) # do other work in the main thread\nconnection.stop()\n            </code></pre><p>Python-OBD also has facilities for asynchronous usage. Particularly useful with UI event loops, <code>Async</code> connections are executed in a separate thread, and provide event callbacks. The traditional <code>query()</code> function also becomes non-blocking during asynchronous connections.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Sensors</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>Python-OBD supports a wide variety of sensors. However, because each car has a different payload of those sensors, not all of them may be available. To account for this, the library will automatically request a sensor list from the vehicle, and mark the corresponding commands as "supported". A list of support commands is also stored on the connection object for convenience.</p><p>Here are a handful of the sensors that python-OBD supports. For a full list of sensors, see the <a href=http://python-obd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Commands/#mode-01>documentation</a>:</p><ul><li>Calculated Engine Load</li><li>Engine Coolant Temperature</li><li>Fuel Pressure</li><li>Intake Manifold Pressure</li><li>Engine RPM</li><li>Vehicle Speed</li><li>Timing Advance</li><li>Intake Air Temp</li><li>Air Flow Rate (MAF)</li><li>Throttle Position</li><li>Engine Run Time</li><li>Fuel Level Input</li><li>Barometric Pressure</li><li>Time since trouble codes cleared</li><li>Hybrid battery pack remaining life</li><li>Engine fuel rate</li></ul></div><div class=col><p>Non-sensor data, such as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) can also be retrieved. For instance, <code>connection.query(obd.commands.GET_DTC).value</code> will return a list of every trouble code in the vehicle. Since the trouble codes themselves aren\'t very meaningful, this library also has a built-in dictionary of code descriptions, which get resolved automatically.</p><p>If there\'s ever a sensor or command that python-OBD doesn\'t support, it is possible send custom commands to the car. For instance, here is the implementation for the RPM command:</p><pre><code class=language-python>\nfrom obd import OBDCommand\nfrom obd.utils import unhex\n\ndef rpm(_hex):\n    v = unhex(_hex) # helper function to convert hex to int\n    v = v / 4.0\n    return (v, obd.Unit.RPM)\n\ncmd = OBDCommand("RPM",        \\ # name\n                 "Engine RPM", \\ # description\n                 "01",         \\ # mode\n                 "0C",         \\ # PID\n                 2,            \\ # number of bytes returned\n                 rpm)            # decoding function\n            </code></pre></div></div></section><section><h3>Use Case</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>The project that prompted this library was my idea for a heads-up display, called PiHUD.

Widgets representing the various sensors can be added, deleted, positioned, and resized to the drivers liking.</p><p>Currently, PiHUD has widgets for displaying data as gauges, bar graphs, and text/numeral readouts. However, custom widgets can easily be made using plugins that extend the base widget class. This flexibility allows users to further customize their displays.</p><p>This project is also open source, and can be found on my GitHub:<br><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/piHud>https://github.com/brendan-w/piHud</a></p></div><div class=col><img src=/assets/projects/pihud_hardware.jpg></div></div><div class=row><img src=/assets/projects/pihud.png></div></section>'},{}],13:[function(e,t){t.exports='<section><h2>Nuclear Hardware RNG</h2><div class=row><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>C, Linux, Raspberry Pi, <a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/">MightyOhm Geiger Counter</a></td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/kRad>https://github.com/brendan-w/kRad</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>GPLv3</td></tr></table></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>At its core, this project is a random number generator that uses a custom Linux kernel module to gather entropy from radiation.

For a term project, I decided to take this concept literally.</p><p>The black box I constructed is advertised as a closed source symmetric-key encryption device that produces "unbreakable" ciphertext.

Luckily, the internet is a wonderful place, and there are many license exempt options to choose from. Ultimately, I purchased a small epoxy-encased disk meant for the educational market. My isotope-of-choice was Strontium-90, a beta emitter, with a half-life of ~28 years.</p><p>For the detector, I purchased the <a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/">MightyOhm Geiger Counter</a> as a kit. It\'s open source, exceptionally easy to assemble, and even has serial logging capabilities. Overall, a great product, and perfect to experiments such as this.</p><p>To turn the Geiger counter\'s clicks into random numbers, I implemented a small Linux kernel module that feeds entropy to <code>/dev/random</code> via the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/hw_random.h?id=refs/tags/v4.4">hardware RNG API</a>. The module uses the Linux kernel\'s builtin <code>GPIO</code> facilities to watch for short (100μs) pulses from the counter. By registering a rising interrupt, it can maintain a buffer of timestamps from each pulse. Each timestamp provides nanosecond resolution for the timing of a pulse. When the RNG API requests data, the raw timestamps are sent, and are stirred into the entropy pool by the kernel.</p><p>Being unfamiliar with kernel-space programming, this project actually served as a decent introduction. As time goes on, I\'d like to start running tests on the entropy quality and throughput of the system as a whole.</p></div><div class=col><img
