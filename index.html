While my major satisfies my love for interactive systems, I am equally interested in what goes on behind the scenes. Algorithms, cryptography, and kernel programming are all topics that I persue. To that end, I have also developed a strong interest in the Free &amp; Open Source Software community, and am proud to be <a href=http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html>minoring in FOSS at RIT</a>.</p><p>In my spare time, I can be found playing guitar, doing fun things with lasers, and woodworking. My passions music and woodworking have since led me to the art of building pipe organs, and I am currently designing my 3<sup>rd</sup> organ (no joke).

Many pre-existing graphing utilities were rejected because they failed to deliver some piece of data or functionality. In particular, the ability to parse a project without its dependant libraries was a common failing point. So, instead of doing a full syntax parse (that requires numerous headers), this system only searches for function calls and definitions. Once located, they can be linked by name, location, and storage class to generate a call graph. The C language was chosen specifically for its ease and simplicity in linking.</p><p>The parser outputs the following JSON information:</p></div><div class=col><pre><code class=language-javascript>\n{\n    // Files\n    "groups": [\n        "src/buffer.c",\n        "src/fab.c",\n        //...\n    ],\n    \n    // Functions\n    "nodes": [\n        {\n            "name": "init_buffer",\n            "id": 0,\n            "group": 0, //file ID\n            "line": 39  //line number\n        },\n        {\n            "name": "append_buffer",\n            "id": 1,\n            "group": 0,\n            "line": 48\n        },\n        {\n            "name": "make_format",\n            "id": 7,\n            "group": 1,\n            "line": 48\n        },\n        //...\n    ],\n\n    // Function Calls\n    "links": [\n        {\n            "source": 4,\n            "target": 0,\n            "value": 1 //number of calls\n        },\n        {\n            "source": 4,\n            "target": 1,\n            "value": 2\n        },\n        {\n            "source": 9,\n            "target": 8,\n            "value": 62\n        },\n        //...\n    ]\n}\n            </code></pre></div></div></section>'},{}],5:[function(e,t){t.exports='<section><h2>Collector</h2><div class=row><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>C++, SDL 2.0, Python</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/collector>https://github.com/brendan-w/collector</a></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/tag-tool>https://github.com/brendan-w/tag-tool</a></td></tr><tr><td>Documentation</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/collector/blob/master/README.md>https://github.com/brendan-w/collector/blob/master/README.md</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>GPL v2</td></tr></table></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>Collector is an experimental tag-based file manager for linux. It presents the user\'s files as a flat data structure, where they can be selected by tag name, or by manual inclusion and exclusion. These tags can be arbitrarily added or removed from files, and can even be queried with logical set operations.</p></div><div class=col><p>While many commercial operating systems already support some form of file tagging, linux does not, and it is difficult to port existing data from one OS to another. Because of this, tags are stored directly in the file\'s name and path. This allows directory names to function as tags, which helps represent existing folder structures in Collector. When tags are added or removed, Collector will either splice text from the file name, or move the file to a different place in the directory tree. Not only does this help maintain an organized directory structure, but also prevents the need to synchronize a tag database with the filesystem.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Interface</h3><div class=row><img src=/assets/projects/collector.png></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>Collector displays files as a continuous spectrum of square tiles. Files can be selected by simply typing tag selectors into the bar at the top of the window. This will illuminate the selected files in the spectrum, and will load thumbnail previews in the lower half of the window. To help navigate the tag-space, sample tag names are displayed underneath various regions of the spectrum, and a list of sub-tags for the current selection is also shown.</p></div><div class=col><p>Double-clicking on a file (either the tile, or the preview) will open that file in the user\'s default application. Out of the box, this is done using the <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-open>xdg-open</a> utility. When files are opened, Collector will also fill a temporary directory with symlinks to the currently selected files. This makes it easy to work with your file selections in other programs, such as image preview applications.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Tag Handling</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>Tags are parsed from the filepath by splitting them on several delimeters. Currently, these delimeters are <code>,_&amp;=%.-+ ()[]{}/\\</code>. For instance, the following file path would be parsed into these tags:</p><p><code>/sensors &amp; measurement/telescopes/james_web_primary_mirror.jpg</code></p><p><code>sensors</code>&nbsp;<code>measurement</code>&nbsp;<code>telescopes</code>&nbsp;<code>james</code>&nbsp;<code>web</code>&nbsp;<code>primary</code>&nbsp;<code>mirror</code></p><p>For safety, file extensions are always ignored, and will never be operated upon during the tagging process.</p><p>Since directory names can function as tags, the addition or removal of tags may move a file to a different directory. To prevent files from being moved too far, a <code>.tagdir</code> file can be placed at the root of your desired folder structure. This will serve as a boundry for file movements, and will later be used to store settings for that particular tag directory.</p></div><div class=col><p>Selections are made by writing simple tag selectors. Files can be matched with bare tags names, or with the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> operators. For instance, the following selection:</p><p><code>space telescope -hubble</code></p><p>will select all of the files with the tags <code>space</code> and <code>telescope</code>, but will exclude any files with the tag <code>hubble</code>. Alternatively, one can use the <code>+</code> operator to include a new tag in the selection. For example:</p><p><code>space telescope -hubble +cats</code></p><p>this selection will include all of the same files as before, but will also include every file tagged with <code>cats</code>. In cases where a file is tagged with both <code>hubble</code> and <code>cats</code>, the later selector (<code>+cats</code>) will take precedence.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>CLI</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>In an effort to follow the doctrine of UNIX, Collector has spawned a seperate CLI application to handle the grunt-work of manipulating tags. This CLI, written in python, allows directory structures to be accessed as if they were sets of tagged files. Multiple tags can be added or removed from files with a single command. Files can also be queried with logical set operations, just like Collector.</p></div><div class=col><pre><code class=language-bash>\n# the directory structure BEFORE tagging\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── .tagdir\n├── a/\n└── some_dir/\n    └── file.txt\n\n# remove tag "dir"\n# add tag "a"\n$ tag -dir +a some_dir/file.txt\n\n# the directory structure AFTER tagging\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── .tagdir\n├── a/\n│   └── some_file.txt\n└── some_dir/\n			</code></pre></div></div></section>'},{}],6:[function(e,t){t.exports='<section><h2>Execute JS</h2><div class=row><table><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>Javascript, UglifyJS2</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td><a href="http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/exejs/">http://people.rit.edu/bcw7044/tools/exejs/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Source Code</td><td><a href=https://github.com/brendan-w/execute-js>https://github.com/brendan-w/execute-js</a></td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td>LGPL v3</td></tr></table></div><div class=row><div class=col><p>This tool visualizes Javascript as it executes in a web browser.

Threaded callbacks can also be subscribed, allowing for asynchronous applications.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Code Examples</h3><div class=row><div class=col><pre><code class=language-python>\nimport obd\n\nconnection = obd.OBD() # auto-connects to USB or RF port\n\ncmd = obd.commands.RPM # select an OBD command (sensor)\n\nresponse = connection.query(cmd) # send the command, and parse the response\n\nprint(response) # "2410 RPM"\n            </code></pre><p>This is a simple script that prints the current RPM of the engine. <code>Response</code> objects contain all of the decoded information from the request, such as the value and units for the sensor.</p></div><div class=col><pre><code class=language-python>\nimport obd\nimport time\n\nconnection = obd.Async() # create an asynchronous connection\n\n# will continuously print new RPM values\ndef new_value(response):\n	print(response)\n\n# keep track of the car\'s RPM\nconnection.watch(obd.commands.RPM, callback=new_value)\n\nconnection.start()\ntime.sleep(5) # do other work in the main thread\nconnection.stop()\n            </code></pre><p>Python-OBD also has facilities for asynchronous usage. Particularly useful with UI event loops, <code>Async</code> connections are executed in a seperate thread, and provide event callbacks. The traditional <code>query()</code> function also becomes non-blocking during asynchronous connections.</p></div></div></section><section><h3>Sensors</h3><div class=row><div class=col><p>Python-OBD supports a wide variety of sensors. However, because each car has a different payload of those sensors, not all of them may be available. To account for this, the library will automatically request a sensor list from the vehicle, and mark the corresponding commands as "supported". A list of support commands is also stored on the connection object for convenience.</p><p>Here are a handful of the sensors that python-OBD supports. For a full list of sensors, see the <a href=http://python-obd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Commands/#mode-01>documentation</a>:</p><ul><li>Calculated Engine Load</li><li>Engine Coolant Temperature</li><li>Fuel Pressure</li><li>Intake Manifold Pressure</li><li>Engine RPM</li><li>Vehicle Speed</li><li>Timing Advance</li><li>Intake Air Temp</li><li>Air Flow Rate (MAF)</li><li>Throttle Position</li><li>Engine Run Time</li><li>Fuel Level Input</li><li>Barometric Pressure</li><li>Time since trouble codes cleared</li><li>Hybrid battery pack remaining life</li><li>Engine fuel rate</li></ul></div><div class=col><p>Non-sensor data, such as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) can also be retrieved. For instance, <code>connection.query(obd.commands.GET_DTC).value</code> will return a list of every trouble code in the vehicle. Since the trouble codes themselves aren\'t very meaningful, this library also has a built-in dictionary of code descriptions, which get resolved automatically.</p><p>If there\'s ever a sensor or command that python-OBD doesn\'t support, it is possible send custom commands to the car. For instance, here is the implementation for the RPM command:</p><pre><code class=language-python>\nfrom obd import OBDCommand\nfrom obd.utils import unhex\n\ndef rpm(_hex):\n    v = unhex(_hex) # helper function to convert hex to int\n    v = v / 4.0\n    return (v, obd.Unit.RPM)\n\ncmd = OBDCommand("RPM",        \\ # name\n                 "Engine RPM", \\ # description\n                 "01",         \\ # mode\n                 "0C",         \\ # PID\n                 2,            \\ # number of bytes returned\n                 rpm)            # decoding function\n            </code></pre></div></div></section>'},{}],13:[function(e,t){function n(e){return e+=k,e-=e%k}function o(e){u.className+=" fadeout",setTimeout(e,120)}function i(e,t){v.style.transition=t?"":"none",g.className=e?"":"closed"}function a(){}function r(e){w.innerHTML=e,Prism.highlightAll(),a()}function s(){y=(window.innerHeight-x)/2,y=n(y)+"px","home"===T?m.style.marginTop=y:"project"===T&&a()}function l(){u=document.body,h=document.querySelector("#bg"),m=document.querySelector("#content"),f=document.querySelector("header"),g=document.querySelector("#tower"),v=document.querySelector("nav#projects"),b=g.querySelector(".opener"),w=document.querySelector("article"),b.onclick=function(e){e.preventDefault(),i(!v.clientHeight,!0)},window.onresize=s,s()}function c(e){o(function(){i(!1,!1),u.className="mode-project",r(e)})}function d(){o(function(){m.style.marginTop=y,i(!0,!1),u.className="mode-home"})}function p(e){i(!1,!0),w.style.opacity=0,setTimeout(function(){r(e),w.style.opacity=1},150)}e("prismjs");e("prismjs/components/prism-bash.min.js"),e("prismjs/components/prism-python.min.js"),e("prismjs/components/prism-javascript.min.js");var u,h,m,f,g,v,b,w,y,k=50,x=350,T="";t.exports=function(e,t){function n(){console.info("unprogrammed transition from "+T+" to "+e)}switch(""===T&&l(),t=t||"",e){case"home":if(""===T)d();else{if("project"!==T)return n();
